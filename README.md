# Hidden OP Mini-Analysis

A data-driven exploration of underappreciated but overperforming strategies in Team FIght Tactics. This project uses the Riot API to collect match data and analyze trends that may reveal "hiddenly overpowered" compositions, items, or augments—strategies that are less popular but produce strong results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify underrated game elements—such as units, traits, augments, and item combinations—that consistently achieve high performance despite low pick rates. The analysis is designed to support theorycrafters and competitive players by uncovering these overlooked patterns through data.
